Overview
This project is designed to showcase a microservices-based architecture for modern application development. Each microservice is independently deployable and communicates with others through REST APIs or messaging. The repository includes examples of how to handle service discovery, load balancing, API gateways, and distributed logging.

Architecture
Here’s a high-level view of the system architecture:

[ API Gateway ]
   |
[ Service Discovery ] ---- [ Service A ]
      |                    ---- [ Service B ]
      |                    ---- [ Service C ]
   [ Database ]
Features:
Independent microservices for specific functionalities.
Centralized API Gateway for routing and security.
Service Discovery for dynamic load balancing.
Resilience and fault tolerance with Spring Cloud.
Scalable architecture for adding new services seamlessly.
Technologies Used
Java: Programming Language
Spring Boot: Framework for building microservices
Spring Cloud: For service discovery, configuration, and resiliency
Eureka: Service Discovery
Zuul/Gateway: API Gateway
Feign/RestTemplate: Inter-service communication
MySQL/PostgreSQL: Relational Database
MongoDB: NoSQL Database (if applicable)
Kafka/RabbitMQ: Messaging for asynchronous communication
Docker: Containerization for deployment
Kubernetes: Orchestration (optional)
Microservices
1. Service A (e.g., User Service)
Handles user authentication and management.
Database: MySQL.
Endpoints:
POST /users - Create a user.
GET /users/{id} - Retrieve user details.
2. Service B (e.g., Product Service)
Manages product catalog and details.
Database: MongoDB.
Endpoints:
GET /products - Get all products.
POST /products - Add a new product.
3. Service C (e.g., Order Service)
Processes user orders.
Database: PostgreSQL.
Endpoints:
POST /orders - Place an order.
GET /orders/{id} - Get order details.Microservices Architecture with Spring Boot
